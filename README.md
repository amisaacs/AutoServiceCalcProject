# AutoServiceCalcProject
C# -Calculates auto service bill, breaks out parts and labor and adds tax

Notes:  This was my first try coding doing TDD.
        I thought if I did one push when it was finished 
        all the commits would be included.  However, it didn't work that way.
        
TODO:   See if all projects under solution, AutoServiceCalcTests are included.
        Projects:                       .cs files under project:
