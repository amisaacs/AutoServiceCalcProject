# AutoServiceCalcProject
C# -Calculates auto service bill, breaks out parts and labor and adds tax

Notes:  This was my first try coding doing TDD and I'm excited about it.
        The process felt cleaner and smoother, and I didn't waste time
        on coding things that weren't absolutely necessary. I am really
        proud of how this turned out.
